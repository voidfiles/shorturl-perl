## Setting up for Development

For this to work you need to have a few things installed. Perl, perlbrew, cpanm.

```sh
\curl -L http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash;
perlbrew install-cpanm;
bash ./scripts/init.sh;
```

## Development

Now, anytime you are ready to start doing some development, you can activate the environment.

```sh
bash ./scripts/activate.sh'
```

or, you can use [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv).

Then run the dev server;
